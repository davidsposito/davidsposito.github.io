    <h1>When is openmindedness a virtue?</h1>

    <p>Perhaps it can't be intellectual, because whether or not one should dismiss a candidate idea on face is a practical question relating to the opportunity cost of his time, and how bad the idea truly is from first glance (should you always be able to say why a bad idea is bad?). Relying on statistical tells or intuition, rather than verbalizing specific challenges (which of course would then prompt a whole new line of reasoning, its errors also glaring but illegible) trades some accuracy for lots of time. But our legalistic intuitions make us think: Relying on anything other than the merits is unfair. We didn't give the idea its due. Relatedly: Humility may be attractive to others, but there is a fact of the matter about one's own merits, abilities, and rank. The humble person trades honesty and clarity to be amenable. If openmindedness humility about ideas, then it cannot be an intellectual virtue.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Perhaps it's merely an interpersonal virtue: Openminded people allow others to 'state their case' and be judged on their own terms, rather than in a stereotyped way. They don't statistically discriminate, and honor proponents' rights to be treated as individuals. Openmindedness then is a virtue heaped on to those who have ideas often stereotyped, even those who may generally deserve it....</p>
    <br>
    <p>Or expand that definition outside the interpersonal: Openminded people, like experienced meditators, see things as they really are, and judge ideas on the merits, again without stereotypes or the illusion of essence. In this case, even the ideas have rights. Well, then an openminded person may judge everything fairly but end up without any contrarian beliefs. That's ok, because openmindedness is a disposition, not a summary of beliefs.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But are those senses compatible? Can it be both that the precise amount of openmindedness is both rationally fixed and also that there is a recognizable, praiseworthy practice 'openmindedness' picks out, not found in all people? To my surprise, yes. It's a praiseworthy intellectual virtue because it's right epistemic practice, but not universally manifest, as it requires a patient and diligent mind, and one not easily overcome by emotion. But that optimism only in cases when time abounds (is it then simply redundant, better labelled with 'fairminded'?). When time is scarce, even a potentially openminded person bound by practicality will have to render quick and dirty judgments, without hearing the full case. In fact, 'patience' and 'diligent' are false friends: They seem to be virtuous; in fact, they trade time for virtue. Maybe a worthy trade in many cases, but alloyed nonetheless. (Instead might we say, there are contexts in which patience is appropriate. Well, then we'd be saying "good is a match between (1) a circumstance in which it's good to take X sorts of actions and (2) that circumstance," and any problem with one can be defined out with the other.)</p>
    <br>
    <p>So there is a sense in which openmindedness is best practice, but somewhat luxurious. But at last, we cannot get too far away from real life. I have a stuck impression that even the breathless and important could be more 'openminded' without a cost on their time (set aside cases where better idea-fluency costs time in the short term but makes it back in the long-term).</p>
    <br>
    <p>Perhaps sometimes heuristics and stereotypes are simple distortions? Not likely to be where the error lives. Of course hasty judgments will be wrong at some rate, and intuitions are formed from the whole of experience and so difficult to revise.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It can't simply be that some employ better judgments; then, it wouldn't be openmindedness that's the virtue, but intelligence. The same for a seeming 'receptivity' to ideas.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Perhaps when an evaluator has moderate levels of time (so he is neither so busy that it would be unreasonable to expect him to be diligent, nor is he a lounging aristocrat for whom flippancy is an amusement), we deem him openminded if he chooses to trade some time for fairness. But this seems to praise his fairness, or willingness to sacrifice time, rather than openmindedness-qua-openmindedness. And again, whether or not such a trade is rational is not up to him.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Well, any ideas?</p>
